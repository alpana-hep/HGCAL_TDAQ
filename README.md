DAQ and TPG Studies
this repository contains scripts/steps to corrected the average hits rate for geometry inconsistencies presented between CMSSW and baseline. 
So there are some modules that are HDM in baseline but low density in CMSSW and vice-versa.
There are some other incocnsistancies that includes partial modules but in this study I am considering only full shape modules.
Low density modules having thickness 300um are also excluded because of different s/n values and other readout techn.
